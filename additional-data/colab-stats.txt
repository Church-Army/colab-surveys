Hi Elspeth,

Hope this is the information that you need:

Gender: female – 39 male  -37 other -0
Age: 16-24 – 3  25-34 – 13  35-44 – 19  45-54 - 15  55-64 – 25  65+ -1
Hours contracted: less than 30 hours – 24  30 or more hours  - 52
Length in CA: 6 months or less – 8  7-12 months – 6  1-3 years – 32  4-6 years – 10  7-9 years – 8 10+ years  - 12
Directorate: CEO Office & SLT – 9  Fundraising & Communications – 16  Operations – 10  Community – 4  Finance, Conferencing & Services – 13  Organisational Development - 24
Work role: Resident – 4  Mixed – 54  Remote  18
According to my spreadsheet there are 76 records of people for Co.Lab - Co.Lab doesn’t include conference centre, casual staff or Kelvin (for some reason). Do you want these details for conference centre staff?

I have a sort-of anonymised excel spreadsheet that I can send you with the above data (but in a different format). I have a feeling I may have misinterpreted what was needed, so do let me know.

Thanks,

Phoebe
